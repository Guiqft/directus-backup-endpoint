    Custom Directus endpoint to backup Postgres database using <code>pg_dump</code> and upload the <code>.dump</code> file into Directus files.
    <br />
  </p>
</p>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the following prerequisites on your Directus machine. 

- PostgreSQL Client - [Install PSQL](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/any/postgresql-client). Needs to be installed so Node can spawn `pg_dump` process. If running in Docker, you can check this [example repo](https://github.com/Guiqft/directus-psql-docker-example).

## Usage

Clone this project inside your `/extensions/endpoints` folder, then:

```bash
cd directus-backup-endpoint/
```

```bash
yarn && yarn build
```


After activate the extension, you can just do
```
/POST <directus_url>/backup
```
and check it your `.dump` file into Directus files ðŸš€

## Configuration

You can choose which folder to upload the database `.dump` file, just copy the `.env.example` to your own `.env` and set the `DIRECTUS_BACKUPS_FOLDER` variable to a valid folder name of your Directus instance files.

> For now, this extension supports only `local` as Directus storage
